This is my Stanford's Code In Place's final project
My project will be an Electricity Bill Generator, designed to automate the calculation and generation of electricity bills based on user input. 
This application will allow users to input their personal details and the amount of electricity they have consumed in kilowatt-hours (kWh). 
The program will then calculate the total cost based on a predefined rate per kWh, apply any necessary taxes or additional charges, and generate a detailed bill.
